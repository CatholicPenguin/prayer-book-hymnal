#PBH

## Purpose
The Prayer Book Hymnal is a supplement to the Orthodox BCP (proposed in 2024). It contains the rest of the Feast Days, not included in the BCP. Additionally, the Office propers for all of the Feast Days have been provided, the Hymns set to Gregorian notation. Devotional hymns as well are provided.

##Languages
LuaLaTeX is used for the Prayer Book Hymnal, except for the Devotional Hymns. The Devotional Hymns are made using ABC, then the PDF is inserted via LaTeX.

## Textual Bases
For the Office propers, the Monastic Breviary is used, with Solesmes being used for the notation. For the Mass propers, the English Missal is used. Exceptions for certain Feast Days noted in the comments.

## Status
The Prayer Book Hymnal is currently in its first beta. It is mostly content-complete. Certain hymns still need to be engraved. It is unclear if the Lenten Ferias will be included, since 800 pages is the maximum page count for our project. Holy Week as well has been excised due to concerns about page count. This will require further case testing and thought.
