\begin{hangparas}{1.25em}{1}
Maker of all, eternal King,

Who day and night about dost bring:

Who weary mortals to relieve

Dost in their turn the seasons give:\\

Now chanticleer proclaims the day,

And calls the sun's awak'ning ray,

The wand'ring pilgrim's guiding light,

That marks the watches night by night.\\

Rous'd at the note, the morning star

Heaven's dusky veil uplifts afar:

Night's vagrant bands no longer roam,

But from their dark ways hie them home.\\

The encourag'd sailor's fears are o'er,

The foaming billows rage no more:

Lo! e'en the very Church's Rock

Melts at the crowing of the cock.\\

O let us then all ardent rise;

The cock rebukes our slumb'ring eyes,

Bestirs who still in sleep would lie

And shames who would their Lord deny.\\

New hope his clarion note awakes,

Sickness the feeble frame forsakes,

The robber sheathes his lawless sword,

Faith to the fallen is restor'd.\\

Look on us, Jesu, when we fall,

And with thy look our souls recall:

If thou but look, our sins are gone,

And with due tears our pardon won.\\

Shed through our hearts thy piercing ray,

Our souls' dull slumber drive away:

Thy Name be first on every tongue,

To thee our earliest praises sung.\\

All laud to God the Father be;

All praise, eternal Son, to thee;

All glory, as is ever meet,

To God the Holy Paraclete. Amen.\\

\end{hangparas}

℣. The Lord is King, and hath put on glorious apparel.

℟. The Lord hath put on his apparel, and girded himself with strength.

	Lo! the dim shadows of the night are waning;
    
    Radiantly glowing, dawn of day returneth;
    
    Fervent in spirit, to the mighty Father
   
    Pray we devoutly.\\
    
    So shall our Maker, of his great compassion,
    
    Banish all sickness, kindly health bestowing;
    
    And may he grant us, of a Father's goodness
    
    Mansions in heaven.\\
    
    This he vouchsafe us, God for ever blessed,
    
    Father eternal, Son, and Holy Spirit,
    
    Whose is the glory which through all creation
    
    Ever resoundeth. Amen.\\

O blest Creator of the light,

Who mak'st the day with radiance bright,

And o'er the forming world didst call

The light from chaos first of all:\\

Whose wisdom join'd in meet array

The morn and eve, and named them day:

Night comes with all its darkling fears,

Regard thy people's prayers and tears.\\

Lest, sunk in sin and whelm'd with strife,

They lose the gift of endless life;

While thinking but the thoughts of time,

They weave new chains of woe and crime.\\

But grant them grace that they may strain

The heav'nly gate and prize to gain:

Each harmful lure aside to cast,

And purge away each error past.\\

O Father, that we ask be done

Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son,

Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,

Shall live and reign eternally. Amen.\\

℣. Lord, let my prayer be set forth

℟. In thy sight as the incense.

Thou Brightness of the Father's ray,

True Light of light and Day of day,

Light's fountain and eternal spring,

Thou Morn, the morn illumining!\\

Glide in, thou very Sun divine;

With everlasting brightness shine:

And shed abroad on every sense

The Spirit's light and influence.\\

Thee, Father, let us seek aright,

The Father of perpetual light,

The Father of almighty grace,

Each wile of sin away to chase.\\

Our acts with courage do thou fill;

Blunt thou the tempter's tooth of ill:

Misfortune into good convert,

Or give us grace to bear unhurt.\\

Our spirits, whatsoe'er betide,

In chaste and loyal bodies guide;

Let Faith, with fervour unalloy'd,

The bane of falsehood still avoid.\\

And Christ our daily food be nigh,

And Faith our daily cup supply:

So may we quaff, to calm and bless,

The Spirit's rapt'rous holiness.\\

Now let the day in joy pass on:

Our modesty like early dawn,

Our faith like noontide splendour glow,

Our souls the twilight never know.\\

See! morn pursues her shining way:

True Morning, all thy beams display!

Son with the mighty Father one,

The Father wholly in the Son.\\


All laud to God the Father be;

All praise, eternal Son, to thee;

All glory, as is ever meet,

To God the Holy Paraclete. Amen.\\

\end{hangparas}

℣. O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon.

℟. So shall we rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.

O great Creator of the sky,

Who wouldest not the floods on high

With earthly waters to confound,

But mad'st the firmament their bound:\\

The floods above thou didst ordain;

The floods below thou didst restrain:

That moisture might attemper heat,

Lest the parch'd earth should ruin meet.\\

Upon our souls, good Lord, bestow

The gift of grace in endless flow:

Lest some renew'd deceit or wile

Of former sin should us beguile.\\

Let Faith discover heav'nly light;

So shall her ray direct us right:

And let this Faith each error chase,

And never give to falsehood place.\\

O Father, that we ask be done

Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son,

Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,

Shall live and reign eternally. Amen.\\

The winged herald of the day

Proclaims the morn’s approaching ray:

And Christ the Lord our souls excites,

And so to endless life invites.\\

Take up thy bed, to each he cries

Who sick, or wrapp'd in slumber lies:

And chaste, and just, and sober stand

And watch; my coming is at hand.\\

With earnest cry, with tearful care,

Call we the Lord to hear our pray'r:

While supplication, pure and deep,

Forbids each chasten'd heart to sleep.\\

Do thou, O Christ, our slumbers wake;

Do thou the chains of darkness break:

Purge thou our former sins away,

And in our souls new light display.\\

All laud to God the Father be;

All praise, eternal Son, to thee;

All glory, as is ever meet,

To God the Holy Paraclete. Amen.\\

Earth's mighty Maker, whose command

Rais'd from the sea and solid land;

And drove each billowy heap away,

And bade the earth stand firm for aye:\\

That so the soil might herbage yield,

And blossoms fair to deck the field,

And golden fruit and harvest bear,

And pleasant food for man prepare.\\

Our spirit's rankling wounds efface

With dewy freshness of thy grace:

That grief may cleanse each deed of ill,

And o'er each lust may triumph still.\\

Let every soul thy law obey,

And keep from every evil way:

Rejoice each promis'd good to win,

And flee from every mortal sin.\\

O Father, that we ask be done

Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son,

Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,

Shall live and reign eternally. Amen.\\

Hence, night and clouds that night-time brings,

Confus'd and dark and troubl'd things;

The dawn is here, the sky grows white,

Christ is at hand; depart from sight.\\

Earth's dusky veil is torn away,

Pierc'd by the sparkling beams of day:

The world resumes its hues apace

Soon as the day-star shows its face.\\

But thee, O Christ, alone we seek,

With conscience pure and temper meek:

With tears and chants we humbly pray

That thou wouldst guide us through the day.\\

For many a shade obscures each sense

Which needs thy beams to purge it thence:

Light of the Morning Star, illume,

Serenely shining, all our gloom.\\

All laud to God the Father be;

All praise, eternal Son, to thee;

All glory, as is ever meet,

To God the Holy Paraclete. Amen.\\

O God, whose hand hath spread the sky,

And all its shining hosts on high,

And, painting it with fiery light,

Made it so beauteous and so bright:\\

Thou, when the fourth day was begun,

Didst frame the circle of the sun,

And set the moon for order'd change,

And planets for their wider range:\\

To night and day, by certain line,

Their varying bounds thou didst assign:

And gav'st a signal, known and meet,

For months begun and months complete.\\

Enlighten thou the hearts of men,

Polluted souls make pure again:

Unloose the bands of guilt within,

Remove the burden of our sin.\\

O Father, that we ask be done

Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son,

Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,

Shall live and reign eternally. Amen.\\

Behold the golden dawn arise;

The paling night forsakes the skies:

Those shades that hid the world from view,

And us to dang'rous error drew.\\

May this new day be calmly pass'd,

May we keep pure while it shall last:

Nor let our lips from truth depart,

Nor dark designs engage the heart.\\

So may the day speed on; the tongue

No falsehood know, the hands no wrong:

Our eyes from wanton gaze refrain,

No guilt our guarded bodies stain.\\

For God all-seeing from on high

Surveys us with a watchful eye:

Each day our every act he knows

From early dawn to evening's close.\\

All laud to God the Father be;

All praise, eternal Son, to thee;

All glory, as is ever meet,

To God the Holy Paraclete. Amen.\\

Almighty God, whose will supreme

Made ocean's flood with life to teem;

Part in the firmament to fly,

And part in ocean depths to lie:\\

Appointing fishes in the sea,

And fowls in open air to be;

That each, by origin the same,

Its sep'rate dwelling place might claim :\\

Grant that thy servants, by the tide

Of Blood and Water purifi'd,

No guilty fall from thee may know,

Nor death eternal undergo.\\

Let none despair through sin's distress,

Be none puffed up with boastfulness;

That contrite hearts be not dismay'd,

Nor haughty souls in ruin laid.

O Father, that we ask be done

Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son,

Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,

Eternal glory of the sky,

Blest hope of frail humanity,

The Father's Sole-begotten One,

Yet born a spotless Virgin’s Son;\\

Uplift us with thine arm of might,

And let our hearts rise pure and bright,

And, ardent in God's praises, pay

The thanks we owe him every day.\\

The day-star's rays are glitt'ring clear,

And tell that day itself is near:

The shadows of the night depart;

Thou, holy Light, illume the heart!\\

Within our senses ever dwell,

And worldly darkness thence expel:

Long as the days of life endure,

Preserve our souls devout and pure.\\

The Faith that first must be possess'd,

Root deep within our inmost breast:

And joyous Hope in second place,

Then Charity, thy greatest grace.\\
